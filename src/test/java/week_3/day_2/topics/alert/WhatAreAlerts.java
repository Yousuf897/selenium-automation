    * In web applications, JavaScript alerts are popup boxes that display messages to the user
    * and require interaction before proceeding. They are often used to show important messages,
    * confirmations, or prompt users for input. In Selenium, you can interact with JavaScript alerts
    * using the Alert interface.
    *
Types of JavaScript Alerts

There are three main types of JavaScript alerts:

    Simple Alert
    Confirmation Alert
    Prompt Alert

Each of these alerts serves a different purpose and requires different handling in Selenium.
