    * In HTML forms, checkboxes allow users to select multiple options independently. Unlike radio buttons,
    * each checkbox in a group is independent, so users can select multiple checkboxes at once.

In Selenium, checkboxes can be handled similarly to radio buttons, with additional flexibility to select multiple
* checkboxes at the same time. Selenium provides methods to check if a checkbox is selected, click it to
* select or deselect, and interact with groups of checkboxes.

Working with Checkboxes in Selenium

To interact with checkboxes in Selenium, you can use several methods:

    Clicking a Checkbox to Select or Deselect
    Checking if a Checkbox is Selected
    Selecting Multiple Checkboxes
    Deselecting All Checkboxes
